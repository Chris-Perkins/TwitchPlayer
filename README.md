**THIS IS AN UNOFFICIAL, FAN-MADE WRAPPER. IT IS IN NO WAY ENDORSED BY TWITCH.TV**

## What is It?

Twitch Player is a library that helps you embed Twitch Streams, Clips, Videos, and Collections into your application easily. You can embed directly from the Storyboard or programmatically.

### Example Usage

From the storyboard, drag a WKWebView onto a ViewController. Set it's subclass to `TwitchPlayer` (for Stream, Video, or Collection playing) or `TwitchClipPlayer` (for Clip playing)

You can then modify the variables directly from the Storyboard.

**NOTE: This library uses WKWebView to display libraries. As a result, you cannot use any Twitch Player from the Storyboard before iOS 11.0.**
